# PromptForge

Agent-native context engineering and experimental harness.

PromptForge is a Python layer for transforming, compiling, validating, and experimentally evaluating the context sent to language models.

## What PromptForge does

- Select relevant context for a task.
- Compile alternative structural representations.
- Construct prompts from compiled context.
- Normalize provider execution results.
- Run controlled and reproducible experiments.

## Agent-native workflow

An agent can inspect the task and context, select relevant fields, compile a representation, validate invariants, and execute or evaluate the resulting prompt.

Primary transformation surface:
harness/runner/transforms.py

Task definitions:
tasks/suite.json

Provider adapters:
harness/providers/

Experimental contracts:
harness/prereg/

Retained evidence:
harness/reports/

Regression tests:
tests/

Read AGENTS.md before making experimental or architectural changes.

## V0.9.3 public evidence

The public release retains the V0.9.3 size-matched control: 4 context variants, 4 conditions, 15 repetitions per variant/condition, and 240 scheduled runs.

The primary comparison is pairs_compact versus noop_padded, where the control is padded to the same serialized context size.

V0.9.3 does not establish a universal economic advantage for one representation. Its purpose is to separate structural representation from serialized context size under the tested conditions.

harness/prereg/v093_size_matched_control.md
harness/runner/v093_size_matched_control.py
harness/reports/v093_size_matched_control_deepseek.json

## Quick validation

python -m compileall -q harness tests

python -m unittest discover -s tests -p test_*.py

## Scientific boundary

PromptForge makes context transformations explicit, testable, reproducible, and comparable. Historical results are evidence about the tested conditions, not universal guarantees across every task, model, provider, or prompting strategy.


## 30-second agent path

PromptForge has two public surfaces:

- **Agent core:** provider-agnostic context preparation for real work.
- **Research harness:** reproducible historical experiments, providers, schedules, reports, and preregistration.

When an agent enters the repository, start here:

1. Read `README.md` and `AGENTS.md`.
2. Use `harness.agent.prepare_context()` for arbitrary task data.
3. Use `harness.agent.prepare()` only for the public deterministic fixtures.
4. Read historical runners/reports/providers only when the task actually requires them.

## Install

PromptForge has no runtime dependency on an LLM provider.

```bash
pip install .
```

Then:

```python
from promptforge import prepare_context

prepared = prepare_context(
    data={
        "user": {
            "id": "U-7",
            "name": "Ada",
        },
        "task": {
            "action": "review",
            "commentary": "noise",
        },
    },
    required=["user.id", "task.action"],
)

print(prepared["serialized_context"])
```

The core is usable without OpenAI, DeepSeek, Gemini, API keys, network access, or provider configuration.

## What the agent receives

The handoff artifact contains:

- `context`: the selected structured context.
- `serialized_context`: compact JSON ready for downstream use.
- `selected_arm`: transformation selected.
- `required_paths`: semantic fields that must survive.
- `included_paths` / `excluded_paths`: field-level accounting.
- `required_values_preserved` / `validation`: preservation checks.
- `estimated_tokens`: dependency-free planning estimate.
- `context_chars_saved` / `estimated_tokens_saved`: reduction against the `noop` baseline.
- `candidates`: the alternatives considered.
- `provenance`: source and inclusion metadata for required paths.

Token estimates use UTF-8 byte length divided by four and rounded up. They are a planning heuristic, not an exact provider tokenizer measurement.

## Policies

The default policy is deterministic `minimal_serialized_context`: evaluate the public deterministic transformation arms, validate preservation, and select the smallest serialized context.

For real context under a hard budget:

```python
from promptforge import prepare_context, POLICY_BUDGET_CONSTRAINED

prepared = prepare_context(
    data=my_context,
    required=["task.id", "task.priority"],
    policy=POLICY_BUDGET_CONSTRAINED,
    budget_tokens=1200,
)
```

When `budget_tokens` is supplied with the default `minimal` policy, PromptForge automatically switches to `budget_constrained`.

The policy is a mechanical context-size rule. It is not a claim that the smallest context is universally better for model quality.

## Lightweight schema validation

No validation dependency is required for the core schema contract:

```python
prepared = prepare_context(
    data={
        "task": {"id": "T-17"},
        "score": 0.87,
    },
    required=["task.id"],
    schema={
        "task.id": str,
        "score": float,
    },
)
```

Schema paths are also included in the required set, so the validated fields cannot be silently dropped.

## Inspect before preparing

For planning without transformation:

```python
from promptforge import inspect

report = inspect(
    context,
    required=["task.id", "task.priority"],
)
```

This reports field counts, required-field coverage, serialized size, byte size, and estimated tokens without calling any provider.

## Public fixture

For deterministic repository fixtures:

```python
from harness.agent import prepare

prepared = prepare("T003")
```

T003 demonstrates a reduction from 85 to 48 serialized characters (43.5%) while preserving its required fields. This is a small deterministic fixture, not a general token-savings or model-quality guarantee.

## Architecture map

| Area | Purpose | Start here |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `promptforge/` | Installable public API | End-user integration |
| `harness/agent.py` | Agent-facing facade | Agent integration |
| `harness/context.py` | Generic paths, inspection, token estimation, schema checks | Core context utilities |
| `harness/agent_context.py` | Fixture loading and validated compilation | Repository contract |
| `harness/runner/transforms.py` | Transformation machinery | Transformation semantics |
| `tasks/suite.json` | Public deterministic fixtures | Reproduction |
| `harness/prereg/` | Experimental contracts | Research design |
| `harness/reports/` | Retained empirical evidence | Results |
| `harness/runner/` | Historical experiment execution | Reproduction |
| `harness/providers/` | Experimental provider adapters | Provider-specific work |
| `tests/` | Regression and contract tests | Verification |

Provider adapters are experimental infrastructure. They are not required by the core agent API.

## Research surface

The public release retains the V0.9.3 size-matched control: 4 context variants, 4 conditions, 15 repetitions per variant/condition, and 240 scheduled runs.

V0.9.3 does not establish a universal economic advantage for one representation. Its purpose is to separate structural representation from serialized context size under the tested conditions.

Relevant files:

- `harness/prereg/v093_size_matched_control.md`
- `harness/runner/v093_size_matched_control.py`
- `harness/reports/v093_size_matched_control_deepseek.json`

## Scientific boundary

PromptForge makes context transformations explicit, testable, reproducible, and comparable. Historical results are evidence about the tested conditions, not universal guarantees across every task, model, provider, or prompting strategy.

## What PromptForge is not

PromptForge is not a provider-specific SDK, a universal prompt optimizer, or a claim that one representation is always superior.

The core product is a provider-agnostic context-engineering layer. The research harness exists to make hypotheses, transformations, execution conditions, and historical evidence inspectable and reproducible.
